### How i managed react state in my project.  

Well i am going to discuss about how i managed states in my assignment project.
<hr>
At first i am going to discuss about useState that i used for storing data and set data. It helps to hold data and i a can set data when data is changing. I have used Five useState in my project. First one is for Course second one for selected courses ,third one for total credit hour, fourth for remaining credit, and last one for total price. First i set an initial value for every useState then i set the value that i want set. States are very easy to manage. And that helps developer to manage code easily.

Now i am going to discuss about useEffect.I have used useEffect to manage side effect . I used this to fetch data from json file. useEffect helps to manage side Effects. useEffect hold two things first one is arrow function and second one is dependency.  It helps me to fetch data from API and set data to the useState .
